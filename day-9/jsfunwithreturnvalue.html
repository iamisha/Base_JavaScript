			David Heinemeier Hansson extracted Ruby on Rails from his work on the
			project management tool Basecamp at the web application company
			37signals.[7] Hansson first released Rails as open source in July 2004,
			but did not share commit rights to the project until February
			2005.[citation needed] In August 2006, the framework reached a milestone
			when Apple announced that it would ship Ruby on Rails with Mac OS X v10.5
			"Leopard",[8] which was released in October 2007. Rails version 2.3 was
			released on March 15, 2009, with major new developments in templates,
			engines, Rack and nested model forms. Templates enable the developer to
			generate a skeleton application with custom gems and configurations.
			Engines give developers the ability to reuse application pieces complete
			with routes, view paths and models. The Rack web server interface and
			Metal allow one to write optimized pieces of code that route around Action
			Controller.[9] On December 23, 2008, Merb, another web application
			framework, was launched, and Ruby on Rails announced it would work with
			the Merb project to bring "the best ideas of Merb" into Rails 3, ending
			the "unnecessary duplication" across both communities.[10] Merb was merged
			with Rails as part of the Rails 3.0 release.[11][12] Rails 3.1 was
			released on August 31, 2011, featuring Reversible Database Migrations,
			Asset Pipeline, Streaming, jQuery as default JavaScript library and newly
			introduced CoffeeScript and Sass into the stack.[13] Rails 3.2 was
			released on January 20, 2012 with a faster development mode and routing
			engine (also known as Journey engine), Automatic Query Explain and Tagged
			Logging.[14] Rails 3.2.x is the last version that supports Ruby 1.8.7.[15]
			Rails 3.2.12 supports Ruby 2.0.[16] Rails 4.0 was released on June 25,
			2013, introducing Russian Doll Caching, Turbolinks, Live Streaming as well
			as making Active Resource, Active Record Observer and other components
			optional by splitting them as gems.[17] Rails 4.1 was released on April 8,
			2014, introducing Spring, Variants, Enums, Mailer previews, and
			secrets.yml.[18] Rails 4.2 was released on December 19, 2014, introducing
			Active Job, asynchronous emails, Adequate Record, Web Console, and foreign
			keys.[19] Rails 5.0 was released on June 30, 2016, introducing Action
			Cable, API mode, and Turbolinks 5.[20] Rails 5.0.0.1 was released on
			August 10, 2016, with Exclusive use of rails CLI over Rake and support for
			Ruby version 2.2.2 and above. Rails 5.1 was released on April 27, 2017,
			introducing JavaScript integration changes (management of JavaScript
			dependencies from NPM via Yarn, optional compilation of JavaScript using
			Webpack, and a rewrite of Rails UJS to use vanilla JavaScript instead of
			depending on jQuery), system tests using Capybara, encrypted secrets,
			parameterized mailers, direct & resolved routes, and a unified form_with
			helper replacing the form_tag/form_for helpers.[21] Rails 5.2 was released
			on April 9, 2018, introducing new features that include ActiveStorage,
			built-in Redis Cache Store, updated Rails Credentials and a new DSL that
			allows for configuring a Content Security Policy for an application.[22]
			Rails 5.2.2 was released on December 4, 2018, introducing numerous bug
			fixes and several logic improvements.[23] Rails 6.0 was released on August
			16, 2019, making Webpack default, adding mailbox routing, a default online
			rich-text editor, parallel testing, multiple database support, mailer
			routing and a new autoloader.[24] Rails 6.1 was released on December 9,
			2020, adding per-database connection switching, horizontal database
			sharding, eager loading of all associations, Delegated Types as an
			alternative to single-table inheritance, asynchronous deletion of
			associations, error objects, and other improvements and bug fixes.[25]
			Rails 7.0 was released on December 15, 2021, replacing Node.js and Webpack
			with import maps for JavaScript management by default, replacing
			Turbolinks with a combination of Turbo and Stimulus, adding at-work
			encryption into Active Record, using Zeitwerk exclusively for code
			loading, and more.[26]<br /><br />

		<b>HTTP Servers</b> Ruby on Rails is most commonly not connected to the
		Internet directly, but through some front-end web server. Mongrel was
		generally preferred[by whom?] over WEBrick in the early days,[citation
		needed] but it can also run on Lighttpd, Apache, Cherokee, Hiawatha, Nginx
		(either as a module – Phusion Passenger for example – or via CGI, FastCGI or
		mod ruby), and many others. From 2008 onward, Passenger replaced Mongrel as
		the most-used web server for Ruby on Rails.[42] Ruby is also supported
		natively on IBM i.[43] <strong>JavaScript</strong> Ruby on Rails is also
		noteworthy for its extensive use of the JavaScript libraries Prototype and
		Script.aculo.us for scripting Ajax actions.[44] Ruby on Rails initially
		utilized lightweight SOAP for web services; this was later replaced by
		RESTful <i><b>web services</b></i> Ruby on Rails 3.0 separates the markup of
		the page (which defines the structure of the page) from scripting (which
		determines functionality or logic of the page). jQuery is fully supported as
		a replacement for Prototype and is the default JavaScript library in Rails
		3.1, reflecting an industry-wide move towards jQuery. Additionally,
		CoffeeScript was introduced in Rails 3.1 as the default JavaScript language.
		Web Services Since version 2.0, Ruby on Rails offers both HTML and XML as
		standard output formats. The latter is the facility for RESTful web
		services. CSS Rails 3.1 introduced Sass as standard<b>css</b> templating.
		Template services. CSS Rails 3.1 introduced Sass as standard<b
		></b> templating. <b>Template</b> By default, the server uses Embedded Ruby
		in the HTML views, with files having an html.erb extension. Rails supports
		swapping-in alternative templating languages, such as HAML and Mustache.
		<b>Ruby versions</b> Ruby on Rails 3.0 has been designed to work with Ruby
		1.8.7, Ruby 1.9.2, and JRuby 1.5.2+; earlier versions are not supported.[45]
		Ruby on Rails 3.2 is the last series of releases that support Ruby 1.8.7.
		Framework structure Ruby on Rails is separated into various packages, namely
		ActiveRecord (an object-relational mapping system for database access),
		Action Pack, Active Support and Action Mailer. Prior to version 2.0, Ruby on
		Rails also included the Action Web Service package that is now replaced by
		Active Resource. Apart from standard packages, developers can make plugins
		to extend existing packages. Earlier Rails supported plugins within their
		own custom framework; version 3.2 deprecates these in favor of standard Ruby
		"gems".[46] Deployment Ruby on Rails is often installed using RubyGems, a
		package manager[47] which is included with current versions of Ruby. Many
		free Unix-like systems also support installation of Ruby on Rails and its
		dependencies through their native package management system. Ruby on Rails
		is typically deployed with a database server such as MySQL or PostgreSQL,
		and a web server such as Apache running the Phusion Passenger module.
		Philosophy and design Ruby on Rails is intended to emphasize Convention over
		Configuration (CoC), and the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. The
		Rails Doctrine is an enduring enabler that guides the philosophy, design,
		and implementation of the Ruby on Rails framework. "Convention over
		Configuration" means a developer only needs to specify unconventional
		aspects of the application. For example, if there is a class Sale in the
		model, the corresponding table in the database is called sales by default.
		It is only if one deviates from this convention, such as calling the table
		"products sold", that the developer needs to write code regarding these
		names. Generally, Ruby on Rails conventions lead to less code and less
		repetition.[48] "Don't repeat yourself" means that information is located in
		a single, unambiguous place. For example, using the ActiveRecord module of
		Rails, the developer does not need to specify database column names in class
		definitions. Instead, Ruby on Rails can retrieve this information from the
		database based on the class name. "Fat models, skinny controllers" means
		that most of the application logic should be placed within the model while
		leaving the controller as light as possible. HTML Over The Wire
